# My new and improved site
YAY Jekyll.

I am not a designer, so thanks to **[Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)** for making everything look pretty. Their [Setup Guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/#setup-your-site/) is really good.

## Notes to Self
All featured images should be in a height-to-width ratio of precisely 1 x 2.927 to display consistently.
